# Nuanced Health Diagnosis — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Author:** brainstorm session
**Status:** Decisions resolved (§10), self-review fixes applied. Awaiting
final user sign-off before invoking `writing-plans`.

## 1. Problem

The kundali summary today renders a single Health verdict — one of four Sanskrit tiers
(Uttama / Madhyama / Adhama / Atyadhama) — computed from houses 1, 6, 8 and the four
karaka planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Saturn). This collapses an entire diagnostic picture
into one label and loses the practical signal classical Jyotish actually carries:

> "Your Sun is well-placed (vitality good), but Saturn is debilitated in the 6th and your
> 5th-lord is combust — so your overall verdict can be Madhyama while your *digestive*
> system is Atyadhama and your *bones* are Uttama."

In parallel, the `/medical-astrology` page already computes Prakriti, a 12-region body
map, a 10-year health timeline, and a current prognosis — but those modules are not
wired into the summary card and don't expose the strength-of-significator detail the
classical texts actually weigh.

**Goal of this spec:** Replace the single Health tier with a multi-axis diagnosis where
every meaningful health element has its own score derived from a defined matrix of
planetary, house, sign, dignity, strength, dasha, and transit factors — each
traceable to a classical source. The user sees both the overall picture *and* which
specific subsystem is the weakest link.

---

## 2. Classical sources consulted

We treat the following as authoritative — health interpretations in the matrix below
cite them by short code in square brackets, e.g. `[BPHS-24]`.

### Jyotish primary sources
- **`[BPHS]` Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra** — Ch. 4 (planetary nature and
  dignities), Ch. 12 (house significations including body parts), Ch. 24
  (Roga Adhyaya / disease houses), Ch. 27 (Ashtakavarga), Ch. 45–47
  (Vimshottari dasha phala on health). The Balarishta and Ayur chapters
  (cited as `[BPHS-Balarishta]`, `[BPHS-Ayur]`) are sub-chapters within
  Ch. 24 and the longevity section; `[BPHS-Kemadruma]` refers to the yoga
  treatment in Ch. 38.
- **`[Saravali]` Saravali (Kalyana Varma)** — Ch. 5 (planetary diseases), Ch. 33
  (combinations producing illness).
- **`[Phala-Deepika]` Phala Deepika (Mantreswara)** — Ch. 8 (Roga adhyaya), Ch. 9
  (Maraka and Ayur — death-inflicting / longevity).
- **`[Jataka-Parijata]` Jataka Parijata (Vaidyanatha Dikshita)** — Ch. 5 house
  significations including health, Ch. 7 disease yogas.
- **`[Sarvartha-Chintamani]` Sarvartha Chintamani (Venkatesha)** — Ch. 4 disease yogas
  (Mahadosha, Andhya, Badhira, etc.), Ch. 10 prognosis.
- **`[Hora-Sara]` Hora Sara (Prithuyasas)** — Disease windows in Vimshottari periods.
- **`[Bhrigu-Samhita]`** — Disease-specific yogas (used cautiously; many recensions).
- **`[Jaimini]` Jaimini Sutras** — Karaka theory (especially `GK` Gnati Karaka /
  diseases, `AmK` Amatya Karaka / immunity).

### Ayurveda primary sources
- **`[Charaka]` Charaka Samhita** — Tridosha theory, Prakriti determination, Sutrasthana
  on rasa-rakta-mamsa-medas-asthi-majja-shukra dhatus, ojas as immunity substrate.
- **`[Sushruta]` Sushruta Samhita** — Surgical / anatomical correspondences,
  marma points. Used indirectly: it grounds the body-region ↔ house map in
  `src/lib/medical/constants.ts` (which §6 reuses). No element in §4 cites
  Sushruta directly — its role is anatomical validation.
- **`[Ashtanga-Hridayam]` Ashtanga Hridayam (Vagbhata)** — Synthesis text used for
  body-region ↔ house correspondences where Charaka and Sushruta diverge.

### Specialised systems
- **`[KP]` Krishnamurti Paddhati** — Sub-lord theory for timing health events (only
  used in the dasha/transit activation layer, not the natal baseline).
- **`[Lal-Kitab]`** — Cited only for remedy suggestions, never for diagnosis itself
  (its disease attributions diverge from classical BPHS).

### Modern cross-references (validation, not authority)
- Modern Vedic medical astrology compilations are used only to *cross-check* that the
  matrix below isn't introducing novel claims unsupported by the primary sources.

## 3. Architecture of the diagnosis

Health is not one number. It is a stack of three layers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3: Time-dependent activation                           │
│   - Current mahadasha + antardasha health implication        │
│   - Current transits through health houses                   │
│   - Sade Sati / Dhaiya / 8th-house transit pressure          │
│   → Modifies Layer 1 scores up or down for *this period*     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: Constitutional overlay (Ayurveda — MODE only)       │
│   - Prakriti (Vata / Pitta / Kapha balance)                  │
│   - Dhatu strength (rasa → shukra) via planet-tissue map     │
│   → Colours HOW symptoms appear. Does NOT change any score.  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 1: Natal vulnerability per health element              │
│   - For each of N health elements, score from the matrix     │
│     below using house, lord, occupant, aspect, dignity,      │
│     shadbala, avastha, varga, yoga/dosha inputs              │
│   → Static for life. The "what tends to go wrong" baseline.  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A user-facing element score combines Layer 1 with the Layer 3 multipliers
using the formula in §7. Layer 2 is interpreted as the **mode** (how
symptoms manifest) rather than the magnitude — it never changes the score.

**Hard boundary** (§10 Q6): Jyotish texts govern Layer 1 only — *which*
planet/house/sign contributes. Ayurveda texts govern Layer 2 only — the
*mode* of expression. The two streams never cross-contaminate the scoring.

Example: A 45/100 natal vulnerability for "digestive" with Mars antardasha
running and Saturn currently transiting the 6th becomes ~70/100 for the next
~14 months — and the Ayurvedic mode says "expect Pitta-aggravated heartburn /
acidity, not Vata-driven constipation" because the user is Pitta-dominant.

## 4. The Health Element Matrix

This is the spec's centrepiece. **22 elements total: 19 visible by default + 3
opt-in.** For each: what it covers, the significators classical texts assign to
it, the strength inputs that modulate the score, the signature yogas/doshas that
flag elevated risk, and the activating factors that bring it forward in time.

**Element badges** (per §10 Q3) appear in the element header:
- *(Classical)* — direct grounding in BPHS / Saravali / Charaka / etc.
- *(Inferential)* — modern Jyotish synthesis with weaker classical grounding.
- *(opt-in)* — gated behind extended-analysis toggle (4.20, 4.21, 4.22).
- *(disclaimer-gated)* — Vedic-framing disclaimer required (4.17, 4.21, 4.22).
Elements without an explicit badge are Classical and default-visible.

### Notation
- **Planet IDs:** 0=Sun, 1=Moon, 2=Mars, 3=Mercury, 4=Jupiter, 5=Venus, 6=Saturn,
  7=Rahu, 8=Ketu.
- **Strength inputs** referenced everywhere mean the *standard* set:
  - `Shadbala` — six-fold strength (Sthana, Dig, Kala, Cheshta, Naisargika, Drik)
  - `Avastha` — Baladi (Bala/Kumara/Yuva/Vriddha/Mrita) + Lajjitadi (humiliated etc.)
  - `Dignity` — Exalted / Own / Moolatrikona / Friend / Neutral / Enemy / Debilitated
  - `Vargottama` — same sign in D1 and D9
  - `Combust` — within Sun's combustion orb (Mercury and Venus get reduced
    orbs when retrograde, per BPHS).
  - `Retrograde` — direction of motion
  - `Vimsopaka` — composite varga strength
  - `Ashtakavarga bindus` — points in the relevant house
  - `Bhavabala` — strength of the relevant bhava itself
- **House role** for any planet is either *lord* (rules the sign on the cusp),
  *occupant* (sits in the house), or *aspecting* (drishti).

- **Covers:** Organic nervous-system conditions — tremors, neuropathy,
  Parkinson's-type degeneration, vertigo, sciatica. **Anxiety lives in
  element 4.2** (mental health), not here — the boundary is that 4.2 is

    gender mapping per `[BPHS-12]`), **Moon** (the opposite — left in males,
    right in females), Venus (lustre of the eye), Mercury (the optic nerve).
    **Default behaviour for charts without a specified gender:** treat as
    bilateral (both eyes weighted equally) — the gender-specific
    laterality is purely an interpretive nuance, not a scoring axis, so the
    element score is identical regardless. The laterality is mentioned in
    the textual explanation only when gender is known.
  - Houses: 2nd (right eye — `[BPHS-12]`), 12th (left eye), 6th (eye diseases
    generally).

  - Sun and Moon combust state
  - Sun and Moon dignity
  - 2nd and 12th house Bhavabala, lord placements
- **Signature yogas / doshas:**
  - **Andhya yoga** — Sun + Moon in 2nd, with Mars present →
    blindness/severe-vision signal `[Sarvartha-Chintamani-4]`.

- **Activating factors:**
  - Jupiter mahadasha (esp. with debility activation)
  - Saturn transit over natal Jupiter
- **Source:** `[Jataka-Parijata-5]`, `[Saravali-5]`. **Note:** Endocrine
  diagnosis in Jyotish is more inferential than in BPHS — modern correspondences
  carry less classical weight than items 4.1–4.11.

### 4.13 Immunity / Ojas (Resistance to disease)

- **Covers:** General immune competence, recovery speed, susceptibility to
  infections.
- **Primary significators:**
  - Planets: **Jupiter** (ojas karaka — Jupiter's strength correlates with
    "satva" and "bala", `[Charaka-Sutra]`), Sun (vitality / agni indirectly
    feeds ojas), Lagna lord (overall sharira-bala).
  - Houses: 1st (sharira / body's defence frame), 8th (depletion of vitality
    if afflicted).
  - Jaimini's **Amatya Karaka** has a modern-synthesis correspondence to
    immune-system response but is **not used as a scoring axis** in this
    spec — too inferential and recension-dependent to weight reliably. It
    appears in the textual factor explanation only.
- **Strength inputs:**
  - Jupiter's Shadbala, dignity, avastha
  - Lagna lord dignity and placement
  - Sun's avastha
- **Signature yogas / doshas:**
  - **Jupiter in dusthana (6/8/12) with no aspect from benefic** — low immunity
    signal.
  - **Sade Sati active** — ojas depletion period `[BPHS-46]`.
- **Activating factors:**
  - Jupiter return (~12 yrs)
  - Saturn transit over natal Jupiter
  - 6th-lord antardasha periods
- **Source:** `[Charaka-Sutra]`, `[Jaimini]`, `[BPHS]`.

### 4.14 Chronic / Hidden Disease (Gupta Roga)

- **Covers:** Slow-onset chronic diseases, hard-to-diagnose conditions,
  mysterious symptoms with no clear acute cause. **Explicitly does NOT cover
  cancer/tumour-specific diathesis — that is element 4.21 and is opt-in.** It
  also does not duplicate auto-immune patterns (element 4.20, also opt-in).
- **Primary significators:**
  - Planets: **Saturn** (chronicity itself — Saturn IS chronic, `[BPHS-4]`),
    **Rahu** (mysterious / undiagnosable diseases), **Ketu** (hidden,
    psychosomatic, sudden — appendicitis-type).
  - Houses: **8th** (gupta roga sthana — the literal hidden-disease house
    `[BPHS-24]`), 12th (hospitalisation), 6th (acute disease — feeds into 8th
    when sustained).
- **Strength inputs:**
  - 8th house Bhavabala (strong 8th = good resistance to chronic disease
    paradoxically; **weak** 8th = vulnerability)
  - 8th lord dignity
  - Saturn-Rahu axis placement (raw axis presence only — the
    *malignancy-specific* interpretation lives in 4.21)
- **Signature yogas / doshas:**
  - **Chronic Hidden Disease Pattern:** 8th house heavily afflicted (vulnerability
    > 55, current code matches).
  - **Ketu in 8th aspected by Mars** — sudden surgical events.
  - **(Saturn+Rahu malignancy interpretation deliberately omitted here; see
    4.21.)**
- **Activating factors:**
  - Saturn or Rahu dasha
  - 8th-lord dasha periods (high risk)
- **Source:** `[BPHS-24]`, `[Saravali-5]`, `[Phala-Deepika-9]`.

> **Element boundary note (default vs opt-in):** The Saturn-Rahu axis appears
> here only as a chronicity signal. The same axis is interpreted as a
> *malignancy diathesis* in 4.21 (opt-in). This boundary is enforced in code:
> the opt-in toggle must gate the malignancy interpretation even if 4.14
> renders by default.

---

### 4.21 Cancer / Tumour / Malignancy (Arbuda) *(opt-in, mixed Classical + Inferential)*

- **Covers:** Cancer diathesis. **This element is the most caveated — Jyotish
  identifies a vulnerability pattern, not a diagnosis.**
- **Primary significators:**
  - Planets: **Saturn + Rahu axis** (the classical malignancy signature —
    Saturn for chronic-cellular-degeneration plus Rahu for unnatural growth,
    `[Bhrigu-Samhita]`, `[Saravali]`), Mars when joined with this axis (acute
    transition).

  element are flagged Inferential.

---

### 4.22 Aging / Longevity Specifics (Markesha, Maraka windows) *(opt-in, Classical)*

- **Covers:** Identifying specific life-stage windows of elevated mortality risk

- **Primary significators:**
  - Planets: Saturn (Ayur karaka — longevity granter), 8th lord, Maraka lords
    (2nd and 7th lords — `[Phala-Deepika-9]`).
  - Houses: 8th (Ayur sthana), 3rd (parakrama — vitality reserve), 2nd and 7th
    (Maraka houses).

- **Display rule** (per §10 Q2): Classification (Alpa / Madhya / Purna)
  PLUS risk windows framed as "periods of extra care" derived from Maraka
  dasha onsets and 8th-lord activations. **Never** a numeric year of death
  or a year range.
- **Disclaimer required** (per §10 Q7, Vedic-framing tone).

## 5. Strength-input subsystem (the "planetary strength" layer the user emphasised)

For every element above, the same set of planetary strength inputs is consulted.
This is a single shared subsystem, not 19 separate copies. **All sources below
exist in the codebase today.**

| Strength axis | Source file | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shadbala (six-fold) | `src/lib/kundali/shadbala.ts` | use total strength + ratio |
| Ashtakavarga bindus | `src/lib/kundali/ashtakavarga-*.ts` | per-house bindus |
| Avastha (Baladi) | `src/lib/kundali/avasthas.ts` | use as 0–100 strength |
| Avastha (Lajjitadi) | `src/lib/kundali/avasthas.ts` (`getLajjitadi`) | benefic / malefic / neutral state |
| Dignity | `src/lib/tippanni/dignity.ts` | exalted / own / friend / etc. |
| Vargottama | `src/lib/kundali/sphutas.ts` (D1+D9 compare) | derived |
| Combust | `PlanetPosition.isCombust` flag (see `src/lib/kundali/avasthas.ts:122`) | retrograde-orb correction already applied upstream |
| Vimsopaka | `src/lib/kundali/vimshopaka.ts` | composite varga strength |
| Bhavabala | `src/lib/kundali/bhavabala.ts` | per-house |
| Graha Yuddha | `src/lib/kundali/graha-yuddha.ts` | winner-takes-precedence |

**Output of strength layer for each planet:** a normalised 0–100 score.
**Output of strength layer for each house:** a normalised 0–100 score.

These feed Layer 1 of the diagnosis. **No duplication** — every element uses the
*same* canonical strength numbers, just weighted differently per element.

### 5.1 Universal vs per-element application

To prevent silent gaps: the per-element entries in §4 highlight the strength
inputs that *dominate* that element's score. **But all 10 strength axes above
are computed for every planet/house once per kundali** and made available to
every element's scoring function. An element-specific weight vector
(implemented as part of writing-plans, not here) decides how much each axis
contributes to that element's natal score.

When an element entry in §4 lists e.g. "Mercury's Shadbala, dignity, combust
state" — that means those axes are the *primary* drivers for that element.
Other axes (Ashtakavarga, Bhavabala) still feed in with smaller weights via
the universal weight vector. No element is computed from a partial subset of
the available data.

---

## 6. Constitutional layer (Ayurveda overlay — Layer 2)

Already implemented in `src/lib/medical/prakriti.ts`. Output: Vata/Pitta/Kapha
percentages, primary + secondary dosha, prakriti type.

**How this modulates Layer 1:**

- Doesn't change Layer 1 scores. Layer 2 changes the **mode** — what kind of
  symptom shows up.
- Example: User has 60/100 digestive vulnerability and is Pitta-dominant →
  expect heartburn, ulcers, acid reflux. Same 60/100 in a Vata-dominant person
  → constipation, bloating, IBS.
- Surfaces as a side panel: "Your constitutional bias means digestive issues
  tend to manifest as Pitta-aggravated symptoms (heat, acidity)."

---

## 7. Activation layer (Layer 3 — time-dependent)

Already partially implemented in `src/lib/medical/health-prognosis.ts` and
`src/lib/medical/health-timeline.ts`. Needed extensions:

- **Current dasha/antardasha multiplier** per element. If user is in Mars
  antardasha, all Mars-significated elements (digestive Pitta, accidents,
  inflammation) get a positive contribution for this period. Range:
  `dashaMultiplier ∈ [0, 0.5]`.
- **Current transit multiplier** per element. Saturn transit through user's
  4th → cardiac element gets a positive contribution; sleep gets a smaller
  one. Range: `transitMultiplier ∈ [0, 0.5]`.
- **Sade Sati phase multiplier.** Applied **inside** `transitMultiplier`, not
  separately. When active, every element gets a baseline +0.05 added (with
  larger increments for mental-health, joints, immunity per the per-element
  weights). The per-element activation lists in §4 that mention "Sade Sati"
  are highlighting the *larger* increments — not exclusive coverage.
- **Life-stage gate** — multiplier in `[0.5, 1.5]`. Element-specific function
  of user age. E.g., element 4.7 (bones/joints) starts at 0.6 in early
  adulthood, rises to 1.2 after age 35, 1.5 after 60. Element 4.11
  (reproductive) starts at 0.5 before puberty, 1.0 in reproductive years,
  drops back to 0.7 in post-reproductive years. Default for elements without
  an age curve: constant 1.0.

### 7.1 Engine math

```
displayedScore(element, today) =
    natalScore(element)
    × (1 + dashaMultiplier(element, today))      // ∈ [1.0, 1.5]
    × (1 + transitMultiplier(element, today))    // ∈ [1.0, 1.5] (includes Sade Sati)
    × lifeStageGate(element, age)                // ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Theoretical max: natalScore × 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 = natalScore × 3.375
Clamped to [0, 100].
```

The multiplier bounds are deliberately conservative — natal score (Layer 1)
remains the dominant signal. Layer 3 modulates within ~3x worst case, never
overwhelms.

### 7.2 Trend and next-inflection

- **`trend`:** Compare `displayedScore(element, today)` to
  `displayedScore(element, today + 90 days)`. If the future score is
  ≥10 points lower → `'improving'`. If ≥10 points higher → `'worsening'`.
  Otherwise → `'stable'`. The 90-day horizon catches the next dasha
  sub-period and most transit transitions without lookahead noise.
- **`nextInflectionDate`:** The earliest future date (within the next
  10 years) where `displayedScore` shifts by ≥10 points. Found by walking
  forward through dasha boundaries and Saturn/Jupiter/Rahu transit
  ingresses (those are the slow-moving events). `null` if no such
  inflection exists in the 10-year window.

## 8. Output shape (the data contract — UI is downstream)

### 8.1 Canonical element IDs

The matrix in §4 uses section numbers (4.1, 4.2, …, 4.22). The data contract
uses stable string ids. The mapping is fixed:

| § | id | category | badge | default visible? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | `vitality` | `longevity` | classical | ✅ |
| 4.2 | `mental` | `mental` | classical | ✅ |

### 8.3 Contract notes

- `natalElements` contains 19 entries by default, 22 if `optedInToExtended`
  is true. `hiddenElements` lists the ids that were excluded.
- `currentMultipliers` and `displayedElements` mirror `natalElements` — they
  never contain ids the caller is not entitled to see.
- `disclaimers` is built dynamically: if any opted-in element among 4.17,
  4.21, 4.22 appears in `natalElements`, one disclaimer entry is added with
  the relevant ids in its `scope`.

---

## 9. UI surface (this spec doesn't design the UI, just data flow)

The diagnosis above can drive multiple surfaces:

- **Kundali summary card** — keep one Health tier, but make it expandable
  into the 19-element grid (with the extended toggle revealing 22) with each
  element's own tier + traffic-light colour. Show top 3 weakest elements as
  headline.
- **`/medical-astrology` page** — adds the matrix as a new top section
  consuming `HealthDiagnosis`. The existing four sections (Prakriti, Body
  Map, Timeline, Disease Profile) remain in place below.
- **Dashboard** — top-of-page "current health pressure" widget surfaces the
  3 elements with the highest *current* displayed score (Layer 3
  activation), with next-inflection date.

The UI changes are out of scope for this spec — they belong in a follow-up
once the data contract here is approved.

---

## 10. Resolved decisions (user input 2026-05-27)

1. **Element count → 19 default + 3 gated.** Default surface shows the 19
   elements with strong classical grounding. Three elements require explicit
   user opt-in before they appear:
   - 4.20 Allergies / Autoimmune
   - 4.21 Cancer / Tumour
   - 4.22 Longevity
   Opt-in is a single toggle ("show extended analysis") that reveals all
   three at once. Strong disclaimer attached.

2. **Longevity surfacing → classification + risk windows, no fixed age.**
   Internally compute Pinda + Amsha + Naisargika Ayurdaya. Surface to the
   opted-in user as:
   - Classification (Alpa / Madhya / Purna)
   - Risk windows framed as periods of *extra care* (e.g. "the dasha period
     2032–2034 calls for extra vigilance") — derived from Maraka dasha
     onsets and 8th-lord activations.
   Never display a numeric year-of-death or even a year range. The framing
   is always *windows of care*, never *life expectancy*.

3. **Modern correspondences → two-tier badge.** Every element gets a small
   badge in the UI:
   - **"Classical"** — significators sourced directly from BPHS, Saravali,
     Phala Deepika, Charaka, Sushruta, etc.
   - **"Inferential"** — modern Jyotish synthesis. Currently applies to
     4.12 Endocrine, 4.20 Allergies/Autoimmune, and the modern-medical
     framings within 4.21 Cancer.
   Badge is honest about confidence level without hiding the element.

4. **Consolidation strategy → existing modules become inputs; converge to a
   unified engine; no parallel paths or breakage.**
   - Phase A: New engine consumes outputs of existing `medical/prakriti.ts`,
     `body-map.ts`, `health-timeline.ts`, `disease-profile.ts`,
     `health-prognosis.ts`. Nothing in `medical/*` is touched.
   - Phase B: New engine layers the 19-element matrix on top and exposes
     `computeHealthDiagnosis(kundali)`.
   - Phase C: `/api/medical` route and `/medical-astrology` page both call
     the new engine; existing modules still run under the hood as
     dependencies of the new engine.
   - Phase D: Once consumers are migrated and tests are green, the
     `src/lib/medical/*` directory is reorganised into the new engine's
     namespace (`src/lib/kundali/health-diagnosis/` or similar). Old
     export paths re-exported during migration; old API contract preserved.
   - **Hard rule: no regression in `/api/medical` response shape or
     `/medical-astrology` page behaviour until consumers are explicitly
     migrated.**

5. **`/medical-astrology` page → add matrix as new section, keep existing
   four sections.** No rewrite. The 19-element matrix appears as a new
   "Health Element Diagnosis" section. Prakriti, Body Map, Timeline, and
   Disease Profile remain in their current positions. The new section
   becomes the headline (top of page); existing sections become supporting
   detail.

6. **Source priority → hard Jyotish/Ayurveda boundary.**
   - Jyotish texts govern *which* planet/house/sign contributes to an
     element's score (Layer 1). Ayurveda texts (Charaka, Sushruta,
     Ashtanga Hridayam) inform *how* symptoms manifest — the constitutional
     mode (Layer 2 — vata vs pitta vs kapha colouring).
   - Within Jyotish, when texts disagree: **BPHS first**, then Saravali,
     then Phala Deepika, then Sarvartha Chintamani, then Jataka Parijata,
     then Hora Sara, then Bhrigu Samhita (cautiously).
   - Within Ayurveda: Charaka first for dosha and prakriti; Sushruta for
     anatomy and marma; Ashtanga Hridayam as synthesis tiebreaker.

7. **Disclaimer wording → Vedic-framing tone.** Single disclaimer string
   attached to the three high-stakes elements (4.17 Psychiatric, 4.21
   Cancer, 4.22 Longevity):

   > *"Classical Jyotish describes karmic tendencies, not certainties.
   > These patterns indicate areas to nurture with awareness, not destiny.
   > Modern medical care remains essential."*

   Translated into all visible locales per
   `src/lib/i18n/config.ts` (currently 9: en, hi, ta, te, bn, gu, kn, mai,
   mr). Surfaced prominently (not collapsed) on first display of each
   high-stakes element.

## 11. What this spec deliberately does NOT include

- **Implementation order / phasing.** That belongs in the writing-plans step.
- **UI mockups / component design.** Out of scope here.
- **Database schema changes.** No schema work appears needed — everything is
  computed.
- **Remedy mapping.** Remedies for each element are a separate spec
  (`/lib/remedies/contextual-remedies.ts` exists; matrix needs to map element
  IDs to existing remedies).
- **Backwards compatibility decisions.** The existing single Health tier in
  DomainCard stays for now — the new engine outputs `overall.rating` to keep
  it working. Whether to deprecate the old surface is a UX decision deferred
  to implementation planning.

## 12. Definition of done (for this spec, not implementation)

This spec is *complete* when:

- ✅ Every element catalogued has primary significators, strength inputs,
  classical signatures, activation factors, and source citations.
- ✅ The three-layer architecture is unambiguous (natal × constitutional ×
  current).
- ✅ The strength-input subsystem is identified as a single shared module —
  no duplication.
- ✅ Output data shape is concrete enough that implementation can begin
  without further design questions.
- ✅ All 7 design questions resolved (§10).

**Status: complete.** Ready for `writing-plans` once user signs off on the
updated spec.
